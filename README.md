# The Reserve Model
The simulator used in the "Financing and Managing Epidemiological-Economic Crisis: The Reserve Mode" manuscript.
In a reality where pandemic outbreaks are a matter of time, with both economic and social devastating impacts, economic readiness is a necessary step to ensure the economic strength of a country. In this study, we propose an outline for economic readiness in case of a future crisis. Through the establishment of an emergency fund aimed at funding government excess spending during a crisis, and by adopting a reserve program in the essential sector of the economy, social and economic costs can be reduced
